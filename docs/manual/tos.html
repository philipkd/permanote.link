# 1. Terms of Service.

The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Permanote app and its derivatives, (taken together, our Apps). Our Apps are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, [Permanote's Privacy Policy](http://permanote.link/manual/privacy.html)) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Permanote (collectively, the "Agreement"). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Apps, and these terms will apply to any upgrades. Your agreement is with Nuclear Elements, Inc. Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Apps. By accessing or using any part of our Apps, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Apps. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by Permanote, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.

# 2. Permanote app.

* **Security** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your text files, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the app. Permanote will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
* **Payment** Optional paid services such as extra features are available (any such services, an "Upgrade"). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Permanote the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay or trial basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.
* **Automatic Renewal.** Unless you notify iTunes before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time.

# 3. Intellectual Property.

This Agreement does not transfer from Permanote to you any Permanote or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Permanote. Permanote and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with Permanote or our Apps, are trademarks or registered trademarks of Permanote or Permanote's licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Apps may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Apps grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Permanote or third-party trademarks.

# 4. Changes.

We are constantly updating our Apps, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Apps are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Apps within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Apps will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.

# 5. Termination.

Permanote may terminate your access to all or any part of our Apps at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may simply discontinue using our Apps. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

# 6. Disclaimer of Warranties.

Our Apps are provided "as is." Permanote and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither Permanote nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Apps will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Apps at your own discretion and risk.

# 7. Limitation of Liability.

In no event will Permanote, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to Permanote under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. Permanote shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

# 8. General Representation and Warranty.

You represent and warrant that (i) your use of our Apps will be in strict accordance with the Permanote Privacy Policy, with this Agreement, and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of our Apps will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

# 9. US Economic Sanctions.

You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Apps and or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. Sanctions. Such use is prohibited, and Permanote reserve the right to terminate accounts or access of those in the event of a breach of this condition.

# 10. Indemnification.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Permanote, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of our Apps, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.

# 11. Translation.

These Terms of Service were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms of Service and the English version, the English version will control.

# 12. Miscellaneous.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Permanote and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Permanote, or by the posting by Permanote of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of our Apps will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Permanote may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
