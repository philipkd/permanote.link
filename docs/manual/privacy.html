# Overview

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Permanote we have a few fundamental principles:

* We don't ask you for personal information.
* We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
* We don’t store personal information on our servers.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

Nuclear Elements, Inc. ("Permanote") maintains the Permanote iOS mobile app. It is Permanote’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while using our app.

# App Users

Like most app makers, Permanote collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that apps and servers typically make available, such as the the date and time of each user request. Permanote’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Permanote’s users use its app. From time to time, Permanote may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

# Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Permanote does not gather personally-identifying information.

# Aggregated Statistics

Permanote may collect statistics about the behavior of users of its apps. Permanote may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Permanote does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

# Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Permanote discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Permanote believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Permanote, third parties or the public at large. Permanote takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

# Business Transfers

If Permanote, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Permanote goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Permanote may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

# Privacy Policy Changes

Permanote may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Permanote’s sole discretion. Permanote encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
